## What is Ltac2?

Ltac2 is a meta-programming language designed to write reliable and predictable proof script.
It is the replacement for Ltac1 which had unclear semantics, lacked expressivity, and was slow and error-prone.

In particular, it features:

- A ML language with a strict type system, and datatypes like `list` or `array`
- A predictable call by value semantic
- Effects to manipulate the proof state, backtracking and terms
- A nice foreign-function interface to expose .ml code in Ltac2
- It comes with a [core library](https://github.com/rocq-prover/rocq/tree/master/theories/Ltac2)
  that exposes many .ml function of the kernel to manipulate goals, terms, etc.,
  like unification
